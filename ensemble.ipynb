    "Ensemble learning helps improve machine learning results by combining several models. This approach allows the production of better predictive performance compared to a single model. That is why ensemble methods placed first in many prestigious machine learning competitions, such as the Netflix Competition, KDD 2009, and Kaggle."

    "Ensemble methods are meta-algorithms that combine several machine learning techniques into one predictive model in order to decrease variance (bagging), bias (boosting), or improve predictions (stacking).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble methods can be divided into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bagging (or Bootstrapping aggregation):** Horitzontal aggregation. In bagging different models, obtained by training independent bootstrapped (resampling with replacement) elements, are combined using an aggregation technique (such as majority voting) in order to take the final decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Boosting:**. Horitzontal aggregation. Each component in the aggregation depends on all the others. In Boosting algorithms each classifier is trained on data, taking into account the previous classifiers' success. After each training step, misclassified data increases its weights to emphasise the most difficult cases. In this way, subsequent learners will focus on them during their training. In this kind of techniques the two most well known approaches for linking members are the notions of residual (gradient boosting, XGBoost) or statistical resampling (adaptive boosting aka AdaBoost). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stacking:** Vertical aggregation. In this kind of techniques the output of one member of the ensemble is the input for the next member. We can use different model architectures and stack one on the other to improve the final performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic motivation of parallel methods is to exploit independence between the base learners since the error can be reduced dramatically by averaging.\n",
    "Most ensemble methods use a single base learning algorithm to produce homogeneous base learners, i.e. learners of the same type, leading to homogeneous ensembles.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some methods that use heterogeneous learners, i.e. learners of different types, leading to heterogeneous ensembles. In order for ensemble methods to be more accurate than any of its individual members, the base learners have to be as accurate as possible and as diverse as possible."

    "## Why ensemble learning?\n",
    "**(David)**\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand that why the generalization ability of an ensemble is usually much stronger than that of a single learner, there are three main reasons:\n",
    "- The first reason is that, the training data might not provide sufficient information for choosing a single best learner. For example, there may be many learners perform equally well on the training data set. Thus, combining these learners may be a better choice. \n",
    "- The second reason is that, the search processes of the learning algorithms might be imperfect.For example, even if there exists a unique best hypothesis, it might be difficult to achieve since running the algorithms result in sub-optimal hypotheses. Thus, ensembles can compensate for such imperfect search processes. \n",
    "- The third reason is that, the hypothesis space being searched might not contain the true target function, while ensembles can give some good approximation. For example, it is well-known that the classification boundaries of decision trees are linear segments parallel to coordinate axes. If the target classification boundary is a smooth diagonal line, using a single decision tree cannot lead to a good result yet a good approximation can be achieved by combining a set of decision trees."

    "\n",
    "The Random Subspace Method (RSM) [1] randomly selects an arbitrary number of subspace from the original feature space, and build a classifier on each subspace. This randomization should create classifiers that are complementary. The combination can be carried out by simple fixed rules. Experimental evidences showed that RSM works well with feature spaces with large feature sets and redundant features. It avoids the curse of dimensionality. The concepts of RSM can be related to the theory of stochastic discrimination of Kleinberg [2].\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 8. Random Subspace Method algorithm.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm projects each feature vector into a less dimensional subspace, by selecting m random components. RSM is similar to Bagging but instead of sampling objects, it performs a kind of feature sampling withouth replacement since it would be useless to include one feature more than once. "
